Yeah exactly so you should have 1 coding question(non-LC), 1 debugging, 1 api integration, 1 design, 1 past experiences/behavioral
1:41
If you use Java for the api integration question then they use okhttp so you can get familiar with that
1:42
Also for hiring they split the levels in half (2a vs 2b) to determine pay grade upon joining

enzo  1:43 PM
ahh okay thanks dude!
1:43
should I study LC type questions at all?
1:43
been a while since i did those lol

justchew:bulb:  1:44 PM
maybe, so how the coding question works is they ask an iterative question kinda like square where they dont really care about your efficiency at all but they care more about your code quality
1:45
the difficulty in the question comes when you need to adapt the new feature cause sometimes youll need to change or refactor some the previous work that you did
1:45
Youd benefit a lot from making everything modular and writing clean code (which I think they specifically look for as well)

enzo  1:45 PM
ohh okay that makes sense
1:46
basically like a task at work
1:46
just gotta do it quick i guess
1:46
do you remember what your question was like?
1:46
i heard the descriptions can get suuuper long

justchew:bulb:  1:46 PM
Kinda, I think the question I got was like you need to take in a list of locales like en-US and then another list of locales and return all the locales that match the criteria from the first
1:46
so like you would have a "supported locales" list and another list of locales to match against

enzo  1:47 PM
ahh okay

justchew:bulb:  1:47 PM
later they added stuff like wildcards
1:47
and some ordering requirements etc

enzo  1:47 PM
did you just use a hashtable?

justchew:bulb:  1:47 PM
I think I just did an n^2 loop
1:47
They dont really care about efficiency

enzo  1:47 PM
gotcha

justchew:bulb:  1:47 PM
so it was just the easiest way to model the code

enzo  1:47 PM
sounds good sounds good
1:48
did you ahve to worry about parsing en-US into a Java class or something

justchew:bulb:  1:48 PM
Also come up with test cases after each iteration (suggest them and see if the interviewer wants  to move on or actually test it)
:ok_hand:
1

1:48
Only if you wanted to, I know there's a Locales library or something
1:48
I don't think I used it though since I wasn't familiar with all the nuances of it
1:48
I just made my own Locale class

enzo  1:49 PM
okay nice
1:49
sounds pretty straight forward
1:49
just gotta make it production level code

justchew:bulb:  1:49 PM
Pretty much, don't gotta go too crazy with it tho
1:49
like no getters + setters or whatever

enzo  1:49 PM
Sounds good :+1:
1:50
thanks dudeee

justchew:bulb:  1:50 PM
Are you just doing the phone screen first?
1:50
yeah np

enzo  1:50 PM
yeah just a phone screen
1:50
probably gonna book it sometime next week

justchew:bulb:  1:50 PM
Ok, so the debugging stuff probably wont come til later

enzo  1:50 PM
yeah

justchew:bulb:  1:50 PM
That one is a pretty big code base so I would imagine they aren't able to create new questions often so you'll probably get the same one I did
1:51
I think it was something like a jsonparser library and there was an off by 1 error somewhere

enzo  1:52 PM
ooooo wow thats interesting

justchew:bulb:  1:52 PM
They have failing + passing tests and theyre interested in the strategy you use to debug the code base so I would just start at identifying which tests are failing and how they differ from the other tests

enzo  1:52 PM
they just expect you to step through the code in unit tests?
1:52
gotcha

justchew:bulb:  1:52 PM
Yeah I just used a debugger to step through the code
1:52
The code is pretty complicated though so you wont be able to read the entire thing and try to understand it all

enzo  1:53 PM
fair enough

justchew:bulb:  1:53 PM
So use the existing unit tests as a base to identify suspicious parts of the code and maybe experiment with the logic to see how it affects the tests

enzo  1:53 PM
basically:
figure out which tests are failing
try to udnerstand what the tests are doing
step through code?
1:53
okok makes sense

justchew:bulb:  1:53 PM
yeah pretty much

enzo  1:53 PM
sweet
1:54
thats actually pretty cool
1:54
i much prefer these interviews
1:54
dont really wanna grind LC again

justchew:bulb:  1:54 PM
I think the error was something like, when parsing an array in json it fails to identify the end and makes everything after that array null or something
:ok_hand:
1

1:54
Yeah it was a pretty good experience. If you're good at coding you don't really need to study much for it

enzo  1:54 PM
ill keep that in mind
1:55
i guess i should have my IDE setup
1:55
with all the libraries i want
1:55
also for the bug bashing, they just make you clone a repo?

justchew:bulb:  1:55 PM
If you wanna do LC to prep I would look for questions that aren't super algorithmically dense and focus more on translating thoughts to code than coming up with the algo in the first place
1:55
Yeah you gotta clone the repo

Slackbot  1:55 PM
@enzo changed the message retention policy for this conversation to Retain all messages for a specific number of days. Messages and logs for this channel will be deleted after 365 days.

enzo  1:55 PM
cool cool

justchew:bulb:  1:56 PM
I think for the api integration thing you're given 0 code so have some kind of dependency manager setup
1:56
If youre using java get familiar with maven

enzo  1:56 PM
sounds good
1:56
basically just get familiar with how to load dependencies into the pom right

justchew:bulb:  1:56 PM
Would be good to setup junit and okhttp (I think they require you to use okhttp instead of other libraries cause they want to test if you can adapt a library just by looking at the docs)
1:56
yep

enzo  1:57 PM
ahh ok nice

justchew:bulb:  1:57 PM
for the system design question I was asked to design a metrics aggregation system
1:57
like signalfx or datadog
:ok_hand:
1

1:58
At your YOE you might be able to get a 2B offer which should be about 300-330 (at least thats what I was offered earlier this year)

enzo  1:59 PM
ill def need to brush up on system design
1:59
damn lmfao
1:59
like i would rather stay at Square but that kind of difference is hard to pass up
1:59
Canadian pay is just sucky rn

justchew:bulb:  1:59 PM
You can always rebound later loll
2:00
If you get the offer are you planning on taking it?

enzo  2:00 PM
yeah fingers crossed
2:00
probably
2:00
i'm not sure actually
2:00
id feel really bad cause i like my team
2:01
also WLB is pretty good rn lol
2:01
id basically be hoping to get relocated then promo'd to be able to match up the salary

justchew:bulb:  2:02 PM
Yeah plus youd have to wait until April
2:02
The base probably wont go up by that much either
2:03
Average for l4 seems to be 147k. I think Stripe would give you near 200

enzo  2:03 PM
i'll think about it more seriously if i get an offer
2:03
basically a 50/50

justchew:bulb:  2:04 PM
True no point in stressing until it happens

enzo  2:04 PM
word
2:04
anyway thanks again dude! ill update you
New

justchew:bulb:  2:05 PM
cool np gl
