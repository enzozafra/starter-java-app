1. Given a list of languages in a header and a list of languages a server accepts, return the languages that will be processed in the same order sent in the header.
ex. header = ["en-CA", "en-FR", "en-US"], accepted = ["xy-YZ", "ab-CD", "en-US"]
 => ["en-US"]
 
1 b) Create a testing framework so that you can test this code against inputs easily

2. Assume the header now the server now accepts some languages generically.
ex. header = ["en-CA", "en-FR", "en-US"], accepted = ["xy-YZ", "ab-CD", "en"]
=> ["en-CA", "en-FR", "en-US"]

3. Assume the server can accept a wildcard.
